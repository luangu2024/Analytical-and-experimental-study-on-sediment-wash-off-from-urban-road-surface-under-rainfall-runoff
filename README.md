Analytical and experimental study on sediment wash-off from urban road surface under rainfall runoff

## Overview
This repository contains the Fortran90 implementation of a sediment wash-off model for urban road surfaces. The model incorporates:
- "Control layer" theory for sediment retention dynamics
- "Transport coefficient" concept for detachment characterization
- Key influencing factors:
  - Particle size distribution
  - Initial particle mass distribution
  - Rainfall intensity
  - Road surface slope

The code enables reproduction of the results presented in our study on urban road sediment transport under rainfall conditions.
## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Fortran Compiler**: 
  - GNU Fortran (gfortran 9.0+ recommended)
  - Intel Fortran Compiler (ifort 2021+)
- **Libraries**: Uses only standard Fortran90 modules (no external dependencies)
